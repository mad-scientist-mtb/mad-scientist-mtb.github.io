You need to dress approriately for mountainbiking/fat tire cycling in the colder temperatures of the upper midwest. Here's what has worked for me after two winters outside of the Twin Cities in Minnesota: 


1. 55-65: Normal gloves. Flats with light wool socks. MTB shorts (knee pads, elbow pads, body armor will add a bit of warmth). Alt: mtb pants and long sleeve undershirt. Full face helmet or skullcap. 

2. 45-55: Heavy gloves. Flats, wool socks. MTB pants, long sleeve undershirt, short sleeve shirt, fleece mid layer. Removable vest or puffy jacket for nicer warmup. Full face helmet or skullcap, goggles optional.  

3. 35-45: Warm gloves or bar mitts. Flats, wool socks, toe caps. MTB pants, long sleeve undershirt, fleece mid layer. Light shell w underarm zips. Full face or ski/snowboard helmet + goggles. heavy gloves. 

4. 25-35: Bar mitts with MTB gloves. Five-Ten Impact Pro Mid (or warmer flat) + toe caps or winter cycling boots. Warm pants, long sleeve undershirt, fleece mid layer. Light shell w underarm zips. Full face with skullcap or ski/snowboard helmet. Goggles + neck warmer or face mask. 

5. 15-25: Bar mitts with MTB or warm gloves. Five-Ten Impact Pro Mid (or warmer) + toe caps and foot warmers or 45 NRTH cycling boots. Warm or ski pants, long sleeve undershirt, fleece mid layer. Light shell w underarm zips. Ski/snowboard helmet, goggles, face mask. 

6. Under 15: Bar mitts w/ warm gloves. 45 NRTH winter boots, consider toe warmers. Ski pants, long sleeve undershirt, fleece mid layer. Ski/snowboard outer layer w/ underarm zips. Ski/snowboard helmet, goggles, face mask.
